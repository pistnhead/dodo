## dodo

A very tiny utility to add some text on your MacOSX System Menu.

### Usage:

Create a file named ".dodo.command" in your home directory, and type out a command on single line.

Example:

    whoami
    
Save this file and execute dodo.app, look up.

Replace the command with something useful, enjoy :)
